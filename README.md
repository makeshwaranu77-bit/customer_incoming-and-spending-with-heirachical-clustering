# Customer Incoming & Spending Analysis using Hierarchical Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **customer segmentation** based on **incoming (income) and spending behavior** using **Hierarchical Clustering**. The goal is to identify meaningful customer groups that can help businesses make data-driven decisions such as targeted marketing, personalized offers, and customer retention strategies.

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook:
`customer_incoming_and_spending_with_heirachical_clustering.ipynb`

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-related attributes such as:

* Customer ID
* Annual Income
* Spending Score / Spending Amount

> Note: The dataset is assumed to be clean or minimally preprocessed before clustering.

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Loading** – Import dataset into Pandas
2. **EDA** – Understand distributions and relationships
3. **Preprocessing** – Feature selection and scaling
4. **Hierarchical Clustering** – Using Ward linkage
5. **Dendrogram Analysis** – Determine optimal number of clusters
6. **Model Tra
